The code from this repo here: https://github.com/whaleygeek/pyenergenie/tree/master/src/energenie/drv
will be moved into this folder.

i.e. softbus/spi will be the upstream, and pyenergenie will clone and insert
the code into the dev folder (as the soft spi is really useful for lots
of different projects, and it's master source should not be in one
project only).
